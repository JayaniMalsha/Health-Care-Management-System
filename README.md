# Health-Care-Management-System
Java

The coursework aims to design and implement a Health System API that addresses the complex requirements of modern healthcare management. The API will serve as the foundation for various healthcare applications, providing essential functionalities for patient management, appointment scheduling, medical record keeping, prescription management, and billing. The course is designed to align with specific student learning goals, focusing on REST API design and implementation using JAX-RS.

The system entities include Person, Patient, Doctor, Appointment, Medical Record, Prescription, and Billing. Model classes should be well-implemented with correct attributes, getters, senders, and constructors, with proper use of inheritance and clear hierarchies among classes. DAO implementation should be created with all CRUD methods for corresponding entities, and comprehensive exception handling and validation using HTTP response codes.

Logging and exception handling should be implemented throughout the codebase, providing detailed information for debugging and auditing. Restful resource implementation should follow RESTful principles correctly, with resource methods for retrieving patient details by ID, searching for available appointments, scheduling appointments, managing related entities, accessing medical records, issuing prescriptions, and handling billing following RESTful principles.

Code organization should follow best practices for separation of concerns, modularity, and maintainability, providing clear explanations for codes. When implementing the classes, object-oriented principles like inheritance and encapsulation should be adhered to. For example, when an endpoint for appointments is invoked, the expected JSON output should include information for the doctor and patient, along with the id, date, and time for the appointment. Data structures like List and Map can be used to store data for each entity.
